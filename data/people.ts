Being in person for school feels so nostalgic and I’m so glad that I get to connect with friends, peers, teachers, and everyone once again. Hoco quad days and rallies are so memorable to me, and I can’t describe how happy I am for everyone to experience them once again. Some random things you must know about me: I have an obsession with Lattea, I love going to sf, and I’m very devoted to Spotify.
